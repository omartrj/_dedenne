> **_dedenne,** _n_. A customizable and semantic start page for your browser, built with HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript.

**_dedenne's** offers users a customizable browser start page featuring organized bookmarks and configurable search options. The monospace font is ol' [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code) font loaded via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com). Icons are [inline SVGs](https://css-tricks.com/pretty-good-svg-icon-system/), [DuckDuckGo's API](https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/duckduckgo.com.ico) delivers the favicons, and [OpenWeather's API](https://openweathermap.org) provides the weather forecast and icons. Vanilla JavaScript and CSS handle all interactivity.
